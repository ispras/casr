# CASR: Crash Analysis and Severity Report

CASR &ndash; collect crash reports, triage, and estimate severity.
It is based on ideas from [exploitable](https://github.com/jfoote/exploitable) and
[apport](https://github.com/canonical/apport).

CASR is maintained by:

## Overview

CASR is a set of tools that allows you to collect crash reports in different
ways. Use `casr` binary to deal with coredumps. Use `casr-san` to analyze ASAN
reports. Try `casr-gdb` to get reports from gdb.

Crash report contains many useful information: severity (like [exploitable](https://github.com/jfoote/exploitable)),
OS and package versions, command line, stack trace, register values,
disassembly, and even source code fragment where crash appeared. Reports are
stored in JSON format. `casr-cli` is meant to provide TUI for viewing reports.
Reports triage (deduplication, clustering) is done by `casr-cluster`.
Triage is based on stack trace comparison from [gdb-command](https://github.com/anfedotoff/gdb-command).

## Getting started

1. Install Rust. Instructions can be found [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone CASR repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ispras/casr
```
3. Build CASR:

```
$ cargo build --release
```

## Usage

Create report from coredump:

    $ casr -f core -e bin -o core.casrep

Create report from sanitizers output:

    $ casr-san -o san_bin.casrep -- ./san_bin seed

Create report from gdb:

    $ casr-gdb -o bin.gdb.casrep -- ./bin seed

View report:

    $ casr-cli san_bin.casrep

Create report for program that reads stdin:

    $ casr-san --stdin seed -o san_bin.casrep -- ./san_bin

Deduplicate reports:

    $ casr-cluster -d crash_reports

Cluster reports:

    $ casr-cluster -c crash_reports crash_clusters

## Fuzzing Crash Triage Pipeline

When you have crashes from fuzzing you may do the following steps:

1. Create reports for all crashes via `casr-san` or `casr-gdb` (if no sanitizers
   are present).
2. Deduplicate collected reports via `casr-cluster -d`.
3. Cluster deduplicated reports via `casr-cluster -c`.
4. View reports from clusters using `casr-cli`.
