Please follow the next recommendations for your pull requests:

- compile with *stable* rust
- use `cargo fmt`
- check the output of `cargo clippy --all-features --all --tests`
- run tests `cargo test`
- if you have updated usage of any casr tool, you could simply run
  `update_usage.py` to change the `docs/usage.md` file properly
